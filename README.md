This is the first version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, known as "Triqui" in Colombia.

This game makes part of a proposed lab in the Python Essentials, a course offered by Python Institute, and that I'm taking now thanks to Cisco Networking Academy.

At this moment the game allows playing just against the computer.

The pending upgrades are:

1. Implement the code to play against another player.
2. Implement a scoreboard, in order to know who is gaining the matches.
3. Implement the code using the Pygame library, for a better user experience.
